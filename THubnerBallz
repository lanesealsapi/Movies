ThunderBallz 2: The Rubber Strikes Back
Featuring: Cinnamon & Edward Bluez
(A film nobody asked for ‚Äî but everyone needed.)
[EXT. SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAIN FORTRESS ‚Äì NIGHT]
A stealthy shape skis down the slope on two flaming dodgeballs. It‚Äôs MAX THUNDERBALLZ, back in action, wearing snow camo and aviators.
MAX THUNDERBALLZ (V.O.)
Last time, I stopped Dr. Rubber. But now... he‚Äôs brought friends.
[SMASH CUT TO: UNDERGROUND RAVE CAVE ‚Äì HIMALAYAS]
Laser lights. Drum & bass. Villains dancing poorly. Standing in the center is...
CINNAMON ‚Äì international femme-fatale, ex-gymnast, full-time chaos agent, dressed in a sequin trench coat and juggling two lit Molotov dodgeballs.
CINNAMON
Maxy-boy... thought you‚Äôd melted with the last lair. Guess you‚Äôre stickier than I remembered.
[Enter EDWARD BLUEZ ‚Äì a jazz saxophonist turned assassin. He plays a mean solo that literally knocks out two guards.]
EDWARD BLUEZ
Time to improvise, ThunderBallz.
(he loads dodgeballs into a saxophone like grenades)
MAX THUNDERBALLZ
You always were a bit flat, Bluez.
(pulls out a dodgeball that hums with cosmic energy)
[Suddenly: DR. RUBBER appears on a hologram, now wearing a cape made of bouncy balls.]
DR. RUBBER
Miss me? I‚Äôm launching the Rubbernet, a global trampoline web that‚Äôll bounce Earth into the sun! Try dodging that, ThunderBallz!
MAX THUNDERBALLZ
...I never dodge. I deflect with style.
[Cue action sequence: LLAMAGEDDON parachutes in on a flying Roomba, Cinnamon switches sides mid-fight ‚Äúbecause drama,‚Äù and Bluez uses jazz to hack the mainframe (somehow).]
**CLIMAX: ThunderBallz and Cinnamon double-team a mega-dodgeball into the stratosphere, where it explodes into glitter, disrupting the Rubbernet.]
DR. RUBBER
(shouting as he‚Äôs flung into the sky)
You haven't seen the last of meeeeee‚Äî!
[EXT. TROPICAL ISLAND ‚Äì ONE WEEK LATER]
MAX THUNDERBALLZ (sipping a drink with a dodgeball umbrella)
Well, that was bouncy.
CINNAMON
Too bad the world doesn‚Äôt reward style.
EDWARD BLUEZ
Speak for yourself. I just got a record deal.
[Suddenly... the ground shakes. A deep voice booms from beneath the Earth.]
???:
‚ÄúI... am RUBBER 3.0.‚Äù
[Everyone looks at the camera. Smash cut to black.]
