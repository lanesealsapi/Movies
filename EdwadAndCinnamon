Edward paced slowly behind the curtain, he was nervous, smoked 1 too many cigarretes.
Cinamoon came to mind, her hair and perfume still fresh in his mind, the lipstick was lit that night.
Edward drew his gun slowly and decided it was time to make a move.
Cinamon, he screamed, where the fuck are you?
Sounds horrifying but it was really just the end of a really long first date.

Cinamon here, weaty maybe a little too much whickey, stumbles up the stairs.
For fucks sakesCinamon where the hell were you?
I'm drunk and a Bitch, you know these things....
Damn't Man cut the shit out and get a life, yells one of the audience members, they don't see it coming.
Edward point the gun toward the sky and bam, a bird falls to the ground.
